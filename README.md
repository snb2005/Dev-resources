Discussions
1. Background
In the year 2026, urban logistics have fully transitioned to autonomous drone fleets. However, city regulations have grown increasingly complex. No-Fly Zones (NFZs) are now dynamic areas (e.g., around scheduled stadium events, VIP convoys, or construction sites) that activate and deactivate at specific times.

Your objective is to build a routing engine that manages a fleet of drones to successfully deliver packages while navigating these shifting constraints and optimizing limited battery life.

2. Problem Statement
You are provided with a 2D coordinate grid representing a city. You must develop a system that assigns and routes a fleet of N drones from a central warehouse to complete M deliveries.

Drones start at the warehouse, located at the center of the map: (map_size[0] / 2, map_size[1] / 2)
Each drone can carry multiple packages in a single trip, provided the total weight does not exceed the drone’s max_payload capacity
After completing deliveries, a drone must return to the warehouse or a charging station; mid-air stops are prohibited
All distances are Euclidean (straight-line)
Drones fly in straight lines between consecutive path points
Drones do not collide with one another; multiple drones may occupy the same coordinates simultaneously
3. Constants (Fixed for All Test Cases)
Drone speed: 1 distance unit per timestep
Battery capacity: 500 energy units (per drone, fully charged at start)
Charge rate: 2 energy units per timestep (at charging stations)
Input Format

Your program must accept a JSON file with the following structure:

{
  "map_size": [Width, Height],
  "drones": [
    {"id": "drone_1", "max_payload": 1.0},
    {"id": "drone_2", "max_payload": 0.8}
  ],
  "deliveries": [
    {"id": "d1", "x": 20, "y": 30, "weight": 0.3, "deadline": 200}
  ],
  "charging_stations": [
    {"x": 50, "y": 50, "slots": 2}
  ],
  "no_fly_zones": [
    {
      "shape": "circle",
      "center": [80, 80],
      "radius": 15,
      "T_start": 0,
      "T_end": 150
    },
    {
      "shape": "rectangle",
      "corners": [[120, 120], [140, 160]],
      "T_start": 50,
      "T_end": 300
    }
  ]
}
Field Definitions
map_size: [Width, Height] of the grid. Warehouse is located at (Width/2, Height/2)
drones: List of drones. Each drone includes:
id: Unique identifier
max_payload: Maximum carrying capacity
deliveries: List of delivery requests. Each includes:
id: Delivery identifier
x, y: Coordinates of delivery location
weight: Package weight
deadline: Latest allowable delivery time
charging_stations: List of charging stations:
x, y: Location of the station
slots: Number of drones that can charge simultaneously
no_fly_zones: List of NFZs:
Circle:
center: [x, y]
radius
Rectangle:
corners: [[x_min, y_min], [x_max, y_max]]
T_start and T_end: Active time window

Constraints

1 No-Fly Zones (NFZs)
NFZs are defined as circular or rectangular areas with a specific time window [T_start, T_end]
A drone cannot enter or pass through an NFZ while it is active
NFZs are known upfront; there are no surprise obstacles
A drone may pass through the same area when the NFZ is inactive
NFZ Collision During Transit:

Drones move in straight lines between consecutive path points at a speed of 1. A segment of length d takes d timesteps to traverse.

If a drone departs point A at time t₀ and travels toward point B (distance d), it reaches any intermediate point P at time:

t₀ + dist(A, P)
If an NFZ is active at point P at that time, the path is blocked
If the NFZ deactivates before arrival, the drone may pass through
Waiting Strategy:

If a path is blocked, the drone must wait at its current location
No battery is consumed while waiting
After deactivation, the drone resumes its path
Routing Options:

Detour around active NFZs using waypoints
Wait safely for the NFZ to deactivate
2 Energy Model
Energy consumed per leg is calculated as:

E_leg = distance × (1 + current_payload_weight)
current_payload_weight = total weight of packages on the drone
Payload decreases after deliveries, reducing energy cost
Battery levels must always remain ≥ 0
If a drone cannot complete a trip and return safely, it should not attempt it
3 Charging Stations
Charging stations have limited slots
If all slots are occupied, drones must wait (no battery usage)
Charging rate is 2 energy units per timestep
Drones may leave once sufficient charge is reached (full charge not required)
4 Deliveries & Deadlines
Each delivery has a strict deadline
Arrival must be on or before the deadline
Missed deadlines result in failure (no partial credit)
Packages are picked up at the warehouse and delivered in the field
5 Warehouse & Pickup Rules
PICKUP actions only occur at the warehouse
Upon return, drones are fully recharged to 500 energy units
Drones can make multiple trips:
Warehouse → Recharge → Pickup → Deliver → Repeat
6 Multi-Package Trips
Drones can carry multiple packages if total weight ≤ max_payload
Example route:
Warehouse → Delivery A → Delivery B → ... → Warehouse / Charging Station
Delivery order matters:
Dropping heavier packages first reduces energy costs for later legs
Output Format

Your program must produce a Flight Manifest as a JSON file:

{
  "flight_manifest": [
    {
      "drone_id": "drone_1",
      "path": [
        {
          "x": 50,
          "y": 50,
          "t": 0.0,
          "action": "PICKUP",
          "delivery_ids": ["d1", "d3"]
        },
        {
          "x": 20,
          "y": 30,
          "t": 42.4,
          "action": "DELIVER",
          "delivery_id": "d1"
        },
        {
          "x": 35,
          "y": 60,
          "t": 75.1,
          "action": "DELIVER",
          "delivery_id": "d3"
        },
        {
          "x": 50,
          "y": 50,
          "t": 92.0,
          "action": "RETURN"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Action Types
PICKUP: Drone picks up packages at the warehouse. Must include delivery_ids (list).
DELIVER: Drone delivers a package. Must include delivery_id.
CHARGE: Drone arrives at a charging station to recharge.
CHARGE_COMPLETE: Drone finishes charging and departs.
WAIT: Drone waits at its current position for an NFZ to deactivate.
WAYPOINT: Intermediate navigation point.
RETURN: Drone returns to warehouse or charging station (end of trip).
Scoring
Your solution is scored using a custom checker. The score formula is:

raw_score = (successful_deliveries × 100) − (total_energy × 0.1) − (makespan × 0.05)
Where:

successful_deliveries: Number of deliveries completed on time (arrived at destination ≤ deadline) without any constraint violations.
total_energy: Sum of energy consumed across all drone legs. Energy per leg = distance × (1 + current_payload_weight).
makespan: The latest timestamp in the entire flight manifest (i.e., when the last drone finishes).
Your score per test case is the raw_score. Higher is better. Invalid solutions (constraint violations) score 0. The leaderboard ranks by total score across all test cases.

Validation Rules (violations → score 0)
A drone's path must start with PICKUP and end with RETURN.
Time must be monotonically non-decreasing along each drone's path.
Travel time between consecutive points must equal distance / speed (speed = 1).
Battery must never go below 0.
Payload weight at any point must not exceed max_payload.
No drone path segment may pass through an active NFZ.
A delivery is only counted if the drone arrives at the exact delivery coordinates on or before the deadline.
Each delivery can only be delivered once.

Explanation 0

The drone picks up both packages (total weight 0.7), flies to d1 (distance ≈ 22.36), delivers d1, then flies to d2 (distance ≈ 44.72), delivers d2, and returns to the warehouse (distance ≈ 36.06). Both deliveries arrive well before the deadline of 200.

Successful deliveries: 2/2
Total energy: 22.36×1.7 + 44.72×1.4 + 36.06×1.0 ≈ 38.01 + 62.61 + 36.06 = 136.68
Makespan: 103.14
Raw score: (2×100) − (136.68×0.1) − (103.14×0.05) = 200 − 13.67 − 5.16 = 181.17

Explanation 1

The warehouse is at (100, 100). Delivery d3 is at (100, 10) — directly south. A circular NFZ with center (100, 55) and radius 15 sits between them on the line x=100, active from T=0 to T=150.

Why going directly to d3 first is invalid: The straight path from (100, 100) to (100, 10) passes through (100, 55) — the NFZ center. The drone would reach that point at approximately T=45, well within the NFZ's active window (T=0 to T=150). Any path segment crossing through this zone while it is active scores 0.

Route strategy — avoid the NFZ by timing: Instead of detouring around the NFZ with waypoints, the drone takes a route that naturally avoids it. It flies west to d1, south to d2, then east to d3. All three legs are far from the NFZ (closest approach is 45 units — well outside radius 15). By the time the drone needs to fly north through x=100 on the return leg (T=281), the NFZ has already expired (T=150). The drone passes through the formerly blocked area safely.

Why charging is needed: The total energy for all four legs is 522 units, which exceeds the battery capacity of 500. Conveniently, d3's location (100, 10) is also a charging station. After delivering d3 at T=270, the drone charges for 11 timesteps (22 energy at rate 2/timestep) to have enough battery (90 units) for the 90-unit return leg.

Leg-by-leg breakdown:

Warehouse (100,100) → d1 (10,100): distance = 90, payload = 0.9, energy = 90 × 1.9 = 171. Arrives T=90 ≤ deadline 200 ✓
d1 (10,100) → d2 (10,10): distance = 90, payload = 0.6, energy = 90 × 1.6 = 144. Arrives T=180 ≤ deadline 350 ✓
d2 (10,10) → d3 (100,10): distance = 90, payload = 0.3, energy = 90 × 1.3 = 117. Arrives T=270 ≤ deadline 500 ✓
Charge at (100,10): 11 timesteps, battery 68 → 90. Departs T=281.
d3 (100,10) → Warehouse (100,100): distance = 90, payload = 0, energy = 90 × 1.0 = 90. NFZ expired at T=150, drone passes through at T≈326 ✓
Score calculation:

Successful deliveries: 3/3
Total energy: 171 + 144 + 117 + 90 = 522
Makespan: 371
Raw score: (3×100) − (522×0.1) − (371×0.05) = 300 − 52.2 − 18.55 = 229.25
This example demonstrates three key concepts: NFZ avoidance (the drone cannot fly south early on), time-based NFZ expiry (the return path is safe because the NFZ deactivated), and charging station usage (the drone recharges mid-trip to complete the return).
